# Real Estate Data Automation with Python

## Overview

This project showcases a Python script designed to automate the extraction of real estate data from a prominent website, streamline data entry into Google Forms using Selenium web drivers, and organize responses in Google Sheets. The goal is to simplify the process of gathering and analyzing real estate information, saving time and reducing manual errors.

## Features

- **Web Scraping with Beautiful Soup:**
  - Utilizes Python and Beautiful Soup to scrape real estate data, including prices, locations, and property links, from a target website.

- **Automation with Selenium Web Drivers:**
  - Employs Selenium web drivers to automate the population of Google Forms with the extracted real estate data, ensuring a seamless and accurate data entry process.

- **Efficient Data Compilation in Google Sheets:**
  - Organizes all collected responses from Google Forms in a Google Sheets document, providing a centralized and structured overview of the real estate data.

## Tech Stack

- **Python:** Core language for scripting and automation.
- **Beautiful Soup:** Python library for web scraping.
